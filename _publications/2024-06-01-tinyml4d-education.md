## Abstract
Embedded  machine  learning  (ML)  on  low-power  devices,also known as “TinyML,” enables intelligent applications onaccessible  hardware  and  fosters  collaboration  across  disci-plines to solve real-world problems. Its interdisciplinary andpractical  nature makes  embedded  ML  education  appealing,but barriers remain that limit its accessibility, especially in de-veloping countries. Challenges include limited open-sourcesoftware, courseware, models, and datasets that can be usedwith globally accessible heterogeneous hardware. Our visionis that with concerted effort and partnerships between indus-try and academia, we can overcome such challenges and en-able  embedded  ML  education  to  empower  developers  andresearchers worldwide to build locally relevant AI solutionson  low-cost  hardware,  increasing  diversity  and  sustainabil-ity in the field. Towards this aim, we document efforts madeby the TinyML4D community to scale embedded ML educa-tion globally through open-source curricula and introductoryworkshops  co-created  by  international  educators.  We  con-clude with calls to action to further develop modular and in-clusive resources and transform embedded ML into a trulyglobal gateway to embedded AI skills development.
