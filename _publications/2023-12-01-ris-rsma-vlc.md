## Abstract 
Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a novel paradigm to add a new controllability dimension into wireless communication systems due to its capability to exploit non-line-of-sight paths. In this paper, we study RIS-assisted visible light communication (VLC) utilizing rate splitting multiple access technique (RSMA) to accommodate multiple users. We investigate maximizing the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the RISs parameters, transmitter beamforming design matrix  and RSMA rate allocation. We propose an iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem. We validated the effectiveness of our algorithm via Monte Carlo simulations and showed its superiority compared to other baselines.
