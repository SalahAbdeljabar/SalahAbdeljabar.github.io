## Abstract
Access to quality education remains unequal in rural regions where internet connectivity is scarce. This work proposes a delay-tolerant networking (DTN) framework that uses existing transportation infrastructure as data mules to distribute educational content. The approach provides an affordable and sustainable alternative to always-connected models, with a prototype deployment on a university campus demonstrating feasibility for equitable digital learning.
