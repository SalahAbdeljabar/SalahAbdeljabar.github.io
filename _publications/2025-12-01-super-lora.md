<!--  We propose and experimentally validate a superposition-based method to increase LoRa throughput by encoding additional payload layers compatible with existing LoRa receivers.  -->


## Abstract:
This article presents Super-LoRa, a novel approach to enhancing the throughput of LoRa networks by leveraging the inherent robustness of LoRa modulation against interference. By superimposing multiple payload symbols, Super-LoRa significantly increases the data rate while maintaining lower transmitter and receiver complexity. Our solution is evaluated through both simulations and real-world experiments, showing a potential throughput improvement of up to 5× compared to standard LoRa. This advancement positions Super-LoRa as a viable solution for data-intensive Internet of Things applications, such as smart cities and precision agriculture, which demand higher data transmission rates.
