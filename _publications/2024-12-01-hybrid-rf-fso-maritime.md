## Abstract
Various applications in maritime scenarios, including offshore operation, navigation, and search and rescue, require reliable high-speed communication. However, wireless maritime communication remains challenging due to limited available radio frequency (RF) bandwidth. Additional challenges are imposed by ducting and water surface reflections that lead to high packet loss rates. This work aims to provide a free-space optical (FSO) communication-based solution to address the limited bandwidth issues. An unlicensed 6 GHz RF link is used as a backup for the FSO link during outage events. The hybrid link deployment was conducted on an island located 19 km offshore at the Red Sea shore. The location was chosen based on the need for construction operations led by Red Sea Global (RSG). In addition, the deployment area is considered a challenging environment for FSO due to its high temperatures, humidity, wind speed, and sand/dust storm events. Our findings indicate that the FSO solution successfully achieves a 20 Gbps full duplex with an availability of 98.71%. The overall connectivity remained at 99.999% with the RF as a backup mode. These results highlight the potential of using FSO for high-speed maritime communication and thus connecting remote and unconnected areas.
