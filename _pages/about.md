## Summary
I have expertise in Computer Networking, LoRa communications, and hybrid RF/FSO systems. My background spans system design, signal processing, and software development, with experience in SDRs, Python, MATLAB, and machine learning frameworks. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges and building robust systems in telecommunications and networking.

## Research Interests
- Wireless communications and IoT systems
- Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) and rural connectivity
- Hybrid RF/FSO links for challenging environments
- Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for VLC
- Network optimization and signal processing

## Education
- PhD, Electrical and Computer Engineering, KAUST (May 2023 – Present) — Advisor: Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini
- MS, Electrical and Computer Engineering, KAUST (Aug 2021 – May 2023) — Advisor: Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini
- Erasmus Exchange, Lund University (Aug 2017 – Jan 2018)
- BSc, Electrical Engineering, The University of Jordan — GPA 3.95/4.0 (ranked 1st)

## Highlights
- Designed and implemented superposition techniques to increase LoRa throughput.
- Conducted LoRa transmission experiments over TV White Spaces with Microsoft Research.
- Built a DTN-enabled digital learning platform for rural areas.
- Assisted in deploying hybrid FSO/MW links to connect remote areas and islands.
- Developed positioning and protection systems to assist firefighters in complex environments.
- Investigated and optimized RIS-assisted VLC systems for higher data rates and fairness.

## Publications
